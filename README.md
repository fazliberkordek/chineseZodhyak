What is the Chinese Zodiac?

The Chinese Zodiac is a type of astrology that has been used for 4000 years and defines people with 12 different signs and symbols. The Chinese Zodiac is a circular animal cycle that consists of these 12 signs, each with an equal interval of 10 degrees, and it has little to do with stars.
